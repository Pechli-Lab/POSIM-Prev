POSIM-Prev microsimulation model

This repository contains the code used to run the microsimulation model in the manuscript titled: "Development of a microsimulation model to project the future prevalence of childhood cancer in Ontario, Canada".

Results from this model are also accessible through an R Shiny app (https://pechlilab.shinyapps.io/POSIM/).
